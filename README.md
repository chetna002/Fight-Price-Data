Flight Price Data Analysis
Our primary objective is to analyze the flight price data to determine the following:

    Which airline has the highest average flight price? 
    This will help us identify the airline that charges the most for its flights on average.

    What is the average time each airline takes to cover its destinations? 
    This will allow us to assess the typical duration of flights for each airline.

Additional Points to Consider
To ensure a comprehensive analysis, consider the following additional points:

    Data Preparation:
        Clean the Data: Address any missing or inconsistent data entries.
        Ensure Correct Data Types: Verify that price and duration columns are in numerical format.
  Visualizations:

    Price Distribution: Use bar plots or histplot to visualize the distribution of flight prices by airline.
    Duration Distribution: Use bar plots or histplot to visualize the distribution of flight durations by airline.  
  Insights:

    Price Insights: Summarize which airline tends to be more expensive and possible reasons for this.
    Duration Insights: Analyze if there are significant differences in flight durations between airlines.
